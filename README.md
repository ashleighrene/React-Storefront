## Project Description

I will be building a website (using HTML, CSS and Javascript - React) for an online marketplace.

For this project, the Products page will use Routes and direct the user to a store where items will display (from API fetch request).

### MVP Goals

- As a user, I want to easily understand the companies' values.
- As a user, it will be vital that I find the products sold and understand what they are and how much they cost.
- As a user, I want to see other consumer's reviews and feel a sense of community from the site.
- As a user, I want to be able to navigate to the products page from the homepage and back again.

### Stretch Goals

- As a user, I would like to be able to add items to my cart and see the cart display my number of items.
